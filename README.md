### Why I think the article is important

I found the article interesting because I've recently had a profound interest in how viruses work especially how people are able to create these types of ransomware and have it be spread worldwide. It really does make be very wary when going on the internet because while other people are enjoying social media, playing games, doing homework, a whole organization could be undergoing a cyber attack like this which can cause millions in damages.
